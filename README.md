These are the fundamental codes and the set of initial conditions for the article 'Extreme events in globally coupled chaotic maps'.
LSTM.m is used for forecasting events using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) frameworks.
ts_peak.dat is the data file used for training and testing.
initial.dat is the set of initial conditions randomly distributed in the uniform interval [0, 1].
coupled_logistic.py is the code for the system (1) with N = 200 coupled identical logistic maps f (x) = 4x(1 − x) and ε = 0.4995.
